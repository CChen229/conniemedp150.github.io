	I used CSS hex codes to make the page the same pattern in the pattern which merges with the PNG image
This pattern was created using a cool, deep color mood. I knew I wanted to use cool colors and in my mind I had a general idea of a futuristic pattern. I found these colors best suited for my own interests as I prefer to always use colors that are soft textures. My colors could also be discovered during the last few moments where the sky blends into a gradient looking type of color. I put the colors into Illustrator by using the RGB values and used the hex codes for the CSS styling of this page. To create this pattern I used the line tool and had to manually shifting over the items and group them together using command-g,c, and v. I used the pattern tool in order to simplify my efforts. Choosing 5x5 and playing the guessing game with the spacing allowed me to choose what I specifically wanted without doing all of the work with my own effort part by part. I first created the basic pattern in an Art & Illustration file on Illustrator and saved the pattern as a swatch in my libraries. I then brought up this saved swatch in a Film 4k file and created the pattern you see now. The idea was to create a pattern that gives a soft pastel palette type of feel, where the colors blend in to match a futuristic feeling. I am not really sure where this pattern can be used but since it has a space like feel, perhaps it can be used as a backdrop for space themed projects such as the background for displaying the title of a space documentary.
