<p>
The goal of this was to create a shallow depth of field from a large depth of field image. 
When taking the original photo, I didn;'t focus the camera lens too well on my own DSLR so my friend was too much in focus in comparison to the background as I wanted him to be. However, you can dramatically tell the difference after applying the field of blur in photoshop to create an even more shallow depth of field.

Here is the original photo.
