	<img src="images/Image4.jpg" alt="Depth of Field">
</p>
<p>
This image has a shallow depth of field, focusing on my friend in the foreground and the rest of the manhattan skyline in the background. I tried to create this warm yet calm type of feeling with the lowering of the brightness and the balancing of the tones. The Skyline and the sea colors were clashing together into a solid color due to the high exposure, so lowering helped bring back a bit more detail. The main importance of thie picture was to vividly display that depth of field from foreground to background.
<p>
The original raw image was too bright and there was too much noise. The color and tones of the image were clashing with each other. I lowered the exposure and lowered the green yellow tones. I kept the temperature balanced with the tones, bringing out a rather warm side. 

Here's the original image.
