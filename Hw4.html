	This print pattern is made using this color palette in Adobe Color wheel. The colors were made to resemble colors you would see on a pastel paint palette. They are shades of purple, lavender, and gray to resemble the paints. I put the colors into Illustrator using their CMKY values and creating my own swatches. The pattern was created with a line tool. I used a lot of copy, pasting, shifting, and grouping in order to create the pattern I have. The goal of the design was to create a trippy looking pattern. The pattern was created to look modern and future, topped with a gradient. The options within the pattern tool that I used was a grid tile type, and a repeating pattern. Perhaps this pattern can be used in a variety of pastel themed things such as an example for future images that student may be capable of putting to use.
